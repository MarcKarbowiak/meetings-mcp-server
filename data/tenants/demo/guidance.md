# Tenant: demo

## Capture format
- Prefer explicit markers in notes:
  - `Decision:`
  - `Action item:` (include owner + due date)
  - `Open question:`
  - `Risk:`
  - `Dependency:`

## User stories
- Write user stories as: `As a <persona> I want <capability> so that <benefit>`
- Always capture acceptance criteria as bullets under `AC:`

## Gherkin
- Prefer:
  - `Feature:` per capability
  - `Scenario:` per behavior
  - `Given/When/Then` steps, keep each step one line

## Glossary
- "Tenant" = a customer/org; use `tenantId` to scope guidance.
