Decision: Use stdio as the default transport.
Action item: Add a Streamable HTTP entrypoint for later.

As a product owner I want to extract user stories from meeting notes so that I can move faster from conversation to backlog.
AC:
- Recognize explicit "As a ... I want ... so that ..." sentences
- Return follow-up questions when info is missing

Feature: Story extraction
  Scenario: Extract a single explicit story
    Given meeting notes with a user story
    When I run the extractor
    Then I get one structured story

Open question: Should we support scenario outlines?
